# currency-converter

The "Currency Converter" mini project in Java is designed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, focusing on creating an interactive graphical user interface (GUI) with Java Swing components. The application provides users with a user-friendly platform for converting amounts between different currencies.This is our second year miniproject on the subject Object Oriented Programming using Java

The GUI features components such as text fields for entering the amount, combo boxes for selecting source and target currencies, a conversion button, and a result label. The project ensures input validation, handling scenarios where users might input non-numeric values in the amount field. In such cases, user-friendly error messages are displayed to guide users and prompt valid inputs.

The core functionality of the project lies in its currency conversion logic. Exchange rates between various currencies are predefined, and the application performs the conversion based on the user's input and selection. This logic is encapsulated within the project's structure, adhering to OOP principles.

In terms of project structure, it follows OOP principles, encapsulating functionality within a dedicated class named `CurrencyConverterGUI`. Instances of this class are created to instantiate the GUI, showcasing the use of encapsulation and abstraction.

In conclusion, this mini project serves as an educational example of building interactive GUI applications with Java Swing while also incorporating OOP principles for modular design, easy maintenance, and potential future enhancements. The project provides a practical illustration of handling currency conversion logic within the context of a Java application.
